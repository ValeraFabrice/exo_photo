    <h2>Our Team</h2>

    <p>For all the members of our team, headhunting was a deliberate career choice. Most of us began our careers at
        Crédey et Associés.
        This means that we have shared values and a common culture but also that we share information, advice, methods
        and networks.
        This, combined with our specialisation, means that our consultants complement one another and are especially
        effective.</p>

                    <h3>DAVID CREDEY</h3>

                    <p>My motivation stems from the quality and human wealth of our clients and our team. The men and
                        women developing within our world are keen builders of things. They are proud to build a dam,
                        run a port, design aircraft, change towns and cities… It’s a genuine pleasure to complete
                        assignments in such a positive working environment.</p>

                    <h4>PARTNER</h4>
                    <p>I joined Crédey & Associés because of the firm’s human environment and its expertise in the
                        engineering professions; every day we work for enthusiastic clients who have chosen their career
                        and who nurture our curiosity from the point of view of analysing both personalities and skills.

                    <h4>PARTNER</h4>
                    <p>I particularly like the human environment, which reflects our specialities. Our team is serious
                        without taking itself too seriously. The consultants are responsible, committed, straightforward
                        and really nice. They help one another. Our clients are similar. They are doers, practical
                        people, committed to working for the public good.</p>

                    <p>I appreciate the firm’s emphasis on competitive intelligence which enables me to take a different
                        approach to headhunting. One of my main motivations for joining Crédey & Associés was its
                        encouragement for taking initiative, which means that on a daily basis we are entrepreneurs with
                        responsibility for the firm’s development.</p>
